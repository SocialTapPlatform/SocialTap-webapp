I'll help you add private chat functionality. We'll need to modify the models to support private chats and update the UI to allow users to start private conversations.

First, let's create a ChatRoom model:
models.py
Let's update the main routes:
main.py
Update the UI:
templates/index.html
Update the JavaScript:
static/js/chat.js
Update CSS:
static/css/style.css
Now you need to recreate the database with the new schema:
rm -f instance/chat.db
These changes will:

Allow users to create private chats with other users
Show a list of available chats
Support multiple private conversations
Keep messages isolated to their specific chat rooms
The UI now has a split view with chats list on the left and messages on the right. Users can start new chats by clicking the "New Chat" button.

I see the error - the ChatRoom class is not imported in main.py. Let's fix this by adding the import:
main.py
Now try creating a new chat by clicking on a user. The error should be resolved.

I see the issue - there's a circular import between app.py and models.py. Let's fix this by restructuring the imports:
app.py
models.py
main.py

I see the error in the console - we need to add a user loader function for Flask-Login. Let's fix this by adding the missing loader in app.py:
app.py
This adds the required user_loader function that Flask-Login needs to load users from the database. Try refreshing the page now - it should work properly.

I see the issue - there's a problem in the chat.js file's startChat function. Let's fix it:
static/js/chat.js
This fixes the modal handling by properly using Bootstrap's Modal API. Try clicking on a user to start a chat now - it should work correctly.

Can you make it so the user accounts disappear from the new chat dialog when they go offline?

To track online/offline users, we'll need to add a last_seen timestamp to the User model and update it when users make requests. Then we'll filter out users who haven't been active recently when displaying the user list.

First, let's update the User model:
models.py
Now let's update the main.py to track user activity:
main.py
This will automatically update users' last_seen timestamp when they fetch the user list, and only show users who have been active in the last 5 minutes.

I see the error in the console - there's a missing last_seen column in the User table. We need to recreate the database tables to include this new column. Let's drop and recreate the tables:
app.py
Please restart the server after this change. The error should be resolved as the tables will be recreated with the new last_seen column.

I see the error in the console - there's an issue with the datetime import in main.py. Let's fix it:
main.py
This should fix the error and allow users to show up in the new chat dialog. The error was occurring because we needed to import timedelta separately from the datetime module.
